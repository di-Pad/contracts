# d-Pad Café
Join the d-Pad Café to design & Automate a fair, contributions-based Profit-sharing Economy - and split revenues with your Community (you included)!

# Problem & Solution
Profit-sharing is the single, most important step towards Progressive Decentralization and truly autonomous communities. We have worked towards improved DAO structures, more sustainable models for the Creators Economy, and more rewarding fees for DeFi protocols – but still, we have no easy way to bootstrap a profit-sharing economy for decentralized protocols, rewarding our community based on the contribution of each individual.

So that’s what we built. **The d-Pad Café is *the Decentralized Protocol Alliance* to bring Profit-Sharing Economy as a Service to the Polygon Network.** 
We make it a 2-step process for each decentralized protocol to kick-off an automated, Web3-Native Profit-Sharing Agreement. So that you can the exact interaction rate of each user/participant to your protocol, and let our Quadratic Distribution model ensure a fair reward to anyone. You & your founding team included!

## Core values:
1. Self-organization and sustainability
2. Interaction as a currency. 
3. Profit-Sharing & Meritocracy. 

# How we built it
- Entirely built and deployed on **Polygon** Main Net.
- We use **Textile** as a Powerful, direct gateway to IPFS - and decentralized & persistent cloud storage for truly pseudonymous interaction's metadata.
- **DistributedTown** for DAO Contracts & Mutual Credit system.
- **SkillWallet** for self-sovereign, sybil-resistant IDs, based on Skills & Interactions.
- Each action users take on a partner's protocol is transferred as an NFT, so to make it trackable. 
- **Chainlink External adapter** for serverless querying and interaction with the Blockchain.
- **Covalent** for tracking and mapping meaningful interactions of wallet addresses to a specific protocol in order to provide fair shares of profit.
- We use **Superfluid's Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)** to automate a fair, continuous distribution of funds from protocols to users/communities.
