# di-Pad-Cafe contracts

The d-Pad Café is a decentralized (distributed) Launchpad for fair and automated token distribution. It’s based on a continuous flow of token distribution (Superfluid), and it introduces innovative features such as a Native Profit-Sharing agreement for protocols to distribute a fixed or variable amount of funds to the most active members of their community, founding team included, allowing dynamics such as grant distribution and/or recurring payments (i.e.: monthly salaries for a DAO).
If the integrating Partner (individual) doesn’t own a SkillWallet yet, they can easily create one, either by injecting their existing browser wallet (currently only Metamask, additional ones will be possible in the future) or creating a brand new wallet with nickname+password using Torus.
